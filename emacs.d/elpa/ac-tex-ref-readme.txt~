;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This is an auto-complete.el add-on making completion sources for label
;; names in LaTeX \ref{} and \cite{}.
;;
;; Refs and cites are completed from \label{} and \bibitem{}s in the current
;; buffer.  There's no support for multi-file documents.  (AUCTeX and RefTeX
;; have things for that, and for new label creating macros too.)
